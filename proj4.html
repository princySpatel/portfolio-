              <p><b>Image-to-Text Recognition (OCR)</b>: The core of this project is the use of Google's Vision API to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR), accurately extracting the text from the uploaded image of the food label</p> 
		<p>I<b>ntelligent Ingredient Analysis:</b> The extracted text is then processed by an AI model to identify and list the ingredients. It also classifies the food as vegetarian or non-vegetarian based on the ingredient list.</p>
		<p><b>User-Centric Design:</b> The clean and intuitive interface makes it easy for anyone to upload an image and receive instant, actionable information about their food.</p>
		<p>This project demonstrates my proficiency in integrating powerful third-party APIs, building a functional and responsive web application, and utilizing AI for practical, real-world solutions. It highlights a commitment to creating tools that are both innovative and beneficial to users, helping them make informed and healthier choices.</p>
