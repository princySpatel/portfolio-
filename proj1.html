            <h1>My 2D Platformer</h1>
            <p>I made a 2D platformer game using the <b>Godot Engine</b>, drawing inspiration from classic titles like Super Mario Bros. I designed and created all the graphics and assets for the game myself, including the player character, enemies, and level environments. I wrote all the game's code in GDScript, implementing core mechanics like player movement, collision detection, and enemy AI. This project demonstrates my skills in game development, from asset creation to scripting and overall game design.</p>

            <h1>Java Snake Game</h1>
            <p>This project is a complete implementation of the classic Snake game, built from the ground up in Java. The game showcases my ability to develop a fully functional application, with a focus on core programming concepts and game logic.</p>
            <p>Key Features:</p>
            <p><b>Core Game Loop:</b> I implemented the fundamental game mechanics, including snake movement, food generation, and a robust collision detection system.</p>
            <p><b>Score Tracking:</b> The game includes a basic but clear visual interface that displays the player's current score, providing a sense of progression.</p>
            <p><b>Game State Management:</b> I developed a functional "Game Over" screen that is triggered when the snake collides with itself or the walls, providing a definitive end to the game.</p>

            <h1>Unity Terrain and Robot Movement Demo</h1>
            <p>This project showcases a fundamental tech demo built in Unity, serving as a versatile foundation for various game genres. It features a custom-built terrain and integrates Unity's default robot assets. The core functionality includes: </p>
            <p><b>Custom Terrain Generation:</b> A detailed, procedural terrain designed to demonstrate environmental design and navigation.</p>
            <p><b>Default Robot Integration:</b> Utilizes Unity's built-in robots to showcase basic character control and movement scripting.</p>
	<p><b>Executable Build:</b> The project is compiled into a standalone executable (.exe) for direct download and play on Windows-based PCs, highlighting the ability to create and deploy a finished product.</p>
